  <h1>Privacy Policy for PunchPOW</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: 2025-11-13</strong></p>

  <p>
    PunchPOW is a boxing round timer app designed to help you structure your
    training sessions. This privacy policy explains how the app handles your data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    PunchPOW does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally
    identifiable information.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No account is required to use the app.</li>
    <li>No analytics or tracking tools are integrated.</li>
    <li>No usage data is sent to external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>On-Device Data</h2>
  <p>
    Any settings you configure in the app (such as round duration, rest time,
    presets, and similar preferences) are stored locally on your device using
    Apple-provided storage mechanisms (for example, UserDefaults). This data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stays on your device.</li>
    <li>Is not shared with the developer or third parties.</li>
    <li>Is removed if you delete the app from your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Siri and System Integrations</h2>
  <p>
    PunchPOW may use Apple system features such as Siri for voice commands.
    These features are provided and controlled by Apple. The app itself does not
    receive or store your Siri voice recordings. Any processing of your voice
    commands is handled by Apple in accordance with Apple’s own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    PunchPOW may offer an optional in-app purchase to unlock premium features.
    Payment processing is handled by Apple via the App Store. The app does not
    have access to your full payment information. Apple may provide limited
    non-identifiable information (such as whether a purchase was successful) so
    that the app can unlock premium features on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    PunchPOW does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising networks,
    or external SDKs that collect user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    PunchPOW is not directed at children, but it does not contain content that
    is inappropriate for younger users. The app does not collect personal data
    from any user, including children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes.
    If a future update introduces features that involve data collection or
    online services, this policy will be updated to describe those changes.
  </p>
